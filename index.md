## Current Projects

The below projects are currently works in progress.

### [Restaurant Recommender](https://github.com/arielharris/recommender)
Area: EDA, kNN, web scraping, UI

In this project I am building a reommender system for Seattle area restaurants based on ratings from across the web, as well as incorporates a user's personal ratings and those of similar users. 

The approach is to first build a general recommender to understand the concept with a known data source, then incorporate web scraping for that data to become more comfortable with scraping techniques. Next, apply what was built for the general recommender to scraped restaurant data and build user profiles. The final and most challenging step will be to create a user interface and deploy the project, something I am not practiced in, but exctied to learn!

### Medical MBA
Area: Data Mining, EDA

This project is an expansion of the work I did in the below Market Basket Analysis project with a goal of investigating how MBA can be used in fields beyond sales and inventory, such as the medical field. One such instance is predicting a disease based on the symptoms which most commonly present themselves together. 

The techniques developed in the previous MBA project will be applied to [this Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/choongqianzheng/disease-and-symptoms-dataset?select=DiseaseAndSymptoms.csv).

## Top Projects 

### [Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/arielharris/MBA)
Area: Data Mining, EDA

An analysis of sales data using the Market Basket Analysis technique to find out which items are commonly purchased together. This information is important to companies as they can use it to increase revenue by offering bundle deals for popular items or improve customer experience by arranging common items closer together in stores or recommending them for online orders. This approach to MBA uses both the apriori and FP growth algorithms to contrast the two techniques.

### [Mt. Rainier Snowfall Analysis](https://github.com/arielharris/mt_rainier/tree/main)
Area: hyperspectral imaging, SNAP, EDA, Data Visualization, Time Series Analysis, kNN, SVM

The purpose of this project is to utilize hyperspectral imaging and classification analysis to predict the boundary of snowfall on Mt. Rainier. Understanding the snowfall is useful for many reasons, if snowfall is shown to be heavy, then the following months could see heavy flooding from the snow melt runoff. Alternatively, light snowfall could result in drought throughout Eastern Washington because there isnâ€™t enough melt from the mountain. And generally, understanding snow boundaries on the mountain helps us to understand the state of our current climate and understand patterns in the snowfall. To approach this problem, the USGS Earth Explorer and SNAP tools are used to collect and analyze the satellite images. Pixel data is extracted from these images and used to model and classify using algorithms kNN and SVM. Finally, time series analysis is applied and future radiance levels are predicted and run through the classification models previously made.
