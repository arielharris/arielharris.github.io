## Top Projects 

### [Restaurant Recommender](https://github.com/arielharris/recommender)

Under construction! This project is currently a work in progress, but will eventually become a recommender system using web ratings and reviews to suggest restaurants to users in the Seattle area. 

Recent Updates: currently, a basic recommender for movies based on genre and other user ratings has been finished, the next steps are to incorporate web scrapping for additional variables and finally to translate all of that knowledge into restaurants rather than movies

### [Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/arielharris/MBA)

This is a basic python project done in jupyter notebook, done to show an understanding of market basket analysis. It uses [this data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis), but is also available in the master branch. It goes through cleaning and inspecting the data, creating the pivot table for the basket, and finally generating the frequent itemsets and rules. Both apiori and FP growth algorithms are implemented using the mlxtend library. After mining for the frequent itemset rules, several discoveries are found about the data to provide examples of what might be provided to a customer who has requested an MBA.

### [Mt. Rainier Snowfall Analysis](https://github.com/arielharris/mt_rainier/tree/main)

The purpose of this project is to utilize hyperspectral imaging and classification analysis to predict the boundary of snowfall on Mt. Rainier. Understanding the snowfall is useful for many reasons, if snowfall is shown to be heavy, then the following months could see heavy flooding from the snow melt runoff. Alternatively, light snowfall could result in drought throughout Eastern Washington because there isnâ€™t enough melt from the mountain. And generally, understanding snow boundaries on the mountain helps us to understand the state of our current climate and understand patterns in the snowfall. To approach this problem, the USGS Earth Explorer and SNAP tools are used to collect and analyze the satellite images. Pixel data is extracted from these images and used to model and classify using algorithms KNN and SVM. Finally, time series analysis is applied and future radiance levels are predicted and run through the classification models previously made.
